abstract: As wireless systems grow smarter and denser, the ability to pinpoint signal sources quickly and efficiently is more critical than ever. This work introduces a novel approach to direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation that trades powerdemanding antenna arrays for simple, passive backscatter radio tags. Not only it extends passive DoA techniques to handle multiple signal sources, but also leverages randomized tag topologies to enhance robustness. These randomized configurations are especially well suited to environments with synchronization mismatch, turning potential limitations into advantages. Significant gains in accuracy and scalability are demonstrated through simulations and CramÂ´er-Rao Bound analysis, paving the way for energyefficient, spectrum-aware systems.
